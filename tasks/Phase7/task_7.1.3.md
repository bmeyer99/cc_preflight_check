# Task Status (DO NOT DELETE)
- **ID**: 7.1.3
- **Title**: Implement PDF Report Generation Module
- **AssignedTo**: code
- **From**: architect (Task 7.1.3 User Request)
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Assigned
## Details
### Requirements:
- Create a new Python module for generating PDF reports.
- Utilize an open-source Python library for PDF generation (WeasyPrint is recommended, using HTML/CSS as an intermediate format).
- The report should have a clear, professional structure.
- The report must include an executive summary.
- The report must detail findings, including any shortcomings.
- For each shortcoming related to permissions, the report must include a suggested IAM policy snippet to grant the missing permissions.
- The report should be designed to present detailed information without being overwhelming.
### Acceptance Criteria (AC):
- A Python module (`report_generator.py` or similar) is created.
- The module can accept structured data (e.g., from `cc_preflight.py` analysis results) as input.
- The module generates a PDF file as output.
- The PDF report includes:
    - Cover Page (Title, Date)
    - Table of Contents (if feasible with the chosen library and complexity)
    - Executive Summary (overall status, key shortcomings)
    - Detailed Findings (status, description, details of shortcomings)
    - IAM Policy Snippets for remediation of permission-related shortcomings.
- The generated PDF is well-formatted and readable.
- The solution is integrated into the existing CLI or provides a clear way to trigger report generation.
## Planning
- **Dependencies**: Output from the core analysis (e.g., `iam_simulator.py`, `resource_processor.py`).
- **Effort**: Medium
- **Start Date**: 2025-05-17 00:35
- **End Date**:
## Documentation
### Outcome/Summary:
### Issues/Blockers:
### Files:
- `report_generator.py` (new)
- Potentially updates to `cli_handler.py` to integrate report generation.
