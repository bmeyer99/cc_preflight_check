# Task Status (DO NOT DELETE)
- **ID**: 7.1.3
- **Title**: Implement PDF Report Generation Module (Revision 3)
- **AssignedTo**: code
- **From**: architect (Task 7.1.3 User Request & Feedback)
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Completed
## Details
### Requirements:
- Create a new Python module for generating PDF reports.
- Utilize an open-source Python library for PDF generation (WeasyPrint is recommended, using HTML/CSS as an intermediate format).
- The report should have a clear, professional structure.
- The report must include an executive summary.
- The report must detail findings, including any shortcomings.
- For each shortcoming related to permissions, the report must include a suggested IAM policy snippet to grant the missing permissions. **The generation of this policy snippet should be automatic and not prompt the user.**
- The report should be designed to present detailed information without being overwhelming.
- **Generated PDF reports must be saved by default into a subdirectory named `reports/`. This directory should be created if it does not already exist.**
- **The `cc_preflight.py` script should generate the PDF report by default when executed. The `--generate-pdf` flag should be removed or made redundant if PDF generation is default.**
- The `--pdf-output` flag should still allow specifying a custom output path/filename for the PDF report, overriding the default `reports/` location.
### Acceptance Criteria (AC):
- A Python module (`report_generator.py` or similar) is created.
- The module can accept structured data (e.g., from `cc_preflight.py` analysis results) as input.
- The `cc_preflight.py` script generates a PDF report by default upon completion of its checks.
- The PDF report is saved to the `reports/` subdirectory by default.
- The `reports/` subdirectory is created automatically if it doesn't exist.
- The `--pdf-output` argument in `cc_preflight.py` correctly overrides the default output location.
- The PDF report includes:
    - Cover Page (Title, Date)
    - Table of Contents (if feasible with the chosen library and complexity)
    - Executive Summary (overall status, key shortcomings)
    - Detailed Findings (status, description, details of shortcomings)
    - IAM Policy Snippets for remediation of permission-related shortcomings (generated automatically without user prompts).
- The generated PDF is well-formatted and readable.
- The test script (`test_report_generation.py`) runs successfully using `python3` and saves its output to the `reports/` subdirectory.
- **No interactive prompt for IAM policy generation exists in the CLI workflow when generating reports.**
## Planning
- **Dependencies**: Output from the core analysis (e.g., `iam_simulator.py`, `resource_processor.py`).
- **Effort**: Medium
- **Start Date**: 2025-05-17 00:35
- **End Date**: 2025-05-17 00:54
## Documentation
### Outcome/Summary:
Implemented a PDF report generation module using WeasyPrint that converts HTML/CSS to PDF. The module creates professional reports with a clear structure including:

1. Cover page with title, date, and overall status
2. Table of contents for easy navigation
3. Executive summary with key metrics and overall conclusion
4. Detailed findings section showing:
   - Prerequisite check results
   - Permission check results with status and details
5. Remediation section with:
   - Steps to create missing prerequisite resources
   - IAM policy snippets to grant missing permissions

The implementation is integrated into the CLI handler. PDF reports are generated by default.
- The `--pdf-output` command-line option allows specifying a custom path to save the PDF report (defaulting to `reports/` subdirectory).

The report is visually appealing with consistent styling, color-coded status indicators, and a professional layout. It provides a comprehensive overview of the pre-flight check results in a format suitable for sharing with stakeholders.

### Issues/Blockers:
- [2025-05-17 00:42] - Test script execution failed with `python: command not found`. Should use `python3`. (Status: Resolved)
- [2025-05-17 00:42] - An interactive prompt "Would you like to generate an IAM policy document for the missing permissions? (yes/no)" appears. This should be removed as the policy is included in the report by default. (Status: Resolved)
- [2025-05-17 00:44] - Added executable permission to test_report_generation.py to make it executable with python3. (Status: Resolved)
- [2025-05-17 00:47] - PDF reports are not saved in a "reports" subdirectory. (Status: Resolved)
- [2025-05-17 00:48] - Modified report_generator.py to save PDF reports to the "reports/" subdirectory by default and create the directory if it doesn't exist. (Status: Resolved)
- [2025-05-17 00:52] - `cc_preflight.py` does not generate PDF report by default. (Status: Resolved)
- [2025-05-17 00:54] - Modified `cli_handler.py` to generate PDF reports by default and replaced `--generate-pdf` flag with `--no-pdf` flag to opt out of report generation. (Status: Resolved)
