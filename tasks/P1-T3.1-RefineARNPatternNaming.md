# Task Status Template (DO NOT DELETE THIS)

## Task Identification
- **Task #**: P1-T3.1
- **Task Title**: Refine ARN Pattern Generation with Typical Naming Patterns
- **Task Assigned to**: Code Mode
- **Task Assigned from**: Architect Mode (Task 1.1.1)
- **Task Priority**: Medium
- **Task Status**: Assigned

## Task Details
### Requirements:
- Research the typical naming patterns CloudFormation uses when resource names are not explicitly provided in the template. This applies to resources like some IAM roles, Lambda functions, etc. (e.g., `stackName-logicalId-randomString`).
- Incorporate these researched naming patterns as more specific placeholders within the `arn_patterns` in the `RESOURCE_ACTION_MAP` or related ARN generation logic.
- The goal is to make the generated ARNs for simulation more specific than broad wildcards where possible.

### Acceptance Criteria (AC):
- Documentation is produced detailing common CloudFormation auto-naming conventions for relevant resource types (e.g., IAM roles, Lambda functions).
- The `arn_patterns` in `RESOURCE_ACTION_MAP` (or equivalent logic) are updated to use more specific placeholders based on these researched naming patterns for applicable resources.
- Generated ARNs for simulation purposes reflect these more specific patterns, reducing reliance on overly broad wildcards for resources with auto-generated names.

## Planning & Tracking
- **Task Dependencies**: P1-T1.3 (as this task refines `arn_patterns` which are part of `RESOURCE_ACTION_MAP`)
