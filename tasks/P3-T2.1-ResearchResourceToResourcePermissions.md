## Task Identification
- **Task #**: P3-T2.1
- **Task Title**: Research Resource-to-Resource Permission Modeling
- **Task Assigned to**: Code Mode (primarily research, potential for PoC)
- **Task Assigned from**: Architect Mode (Task 1.1.1)
- **Task Priority**: Low (due to complexity, marked as potentially deferred/simplified in plan)
- **Task Status**: Assigned

## Task Details
### Requirements:
- Research and analyze scenarios in the [`connectors_aws_cf-d33f925f6195475daf212fdc8b1919e2-1747407759.yml`](connectors_aws_cf-d33f925f6195475daf212fdc8b1919e2-1747407759.yml) template where one created resource needs to grant permissions to another created resource (e.g., an SQS Queue Policy granting `sqs:SendMessage` to an SNS Topic also created in the template).
- Investigate potential approaches to simulate or statically analyze these interactions pre-flight. The project plan suggests:
    - Identifying such interactions.
    - After simulating the deploying principal's ability to create both resources, perform a secondary, more targeted simulation or static analysis of the generated policy *if its content can be fully resolved pre-flight*.
- Document the identified interactions and the feasibility, pros, and cons of different approaches for pre-flight checking.
- This task may primarily result in a research document or a proof-of-concept for a very specific interaction, given its advanced nature.

### Acceptance Criteria (AC):
- A document is produced detailing specific resource-to-resource permission scenarios found in the Cortex XDR CFT.
- The document outlines at least one potential approach (e.g., secondary simulation, static policy analysis of resolved policy documents) for pre-flight checking of these interactions.
- The feasibility, limitations, and estimated complexity of implementing the proposed approach(es) are discussed.
- If a simplified approach is chosen, its limitations are clearly stated.

## Planning & Tracking
- **Task Dependencies**: Deep understanding of CFT resource interactions and IAM policy structure. May depend on robust intrinsic function resolution (Phase 1 & 2) to fully resolve policy documents.
