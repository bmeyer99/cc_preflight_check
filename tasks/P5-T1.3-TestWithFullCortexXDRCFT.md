## Task Identification
- **Task #**: P5-T1.3
- **Task Title**: Test Script with Full Cortex XDR CFT and Varied Principals
- **Task Assigned to**: Code Mode
- **Task Assigned from**: Architect Mode (Task 1.1.1)
- **Task Priority**: High
- **Task Status**: Assigned

## Task Details
### Requirements:
- Execute the pre-flight check script against the full [`connectors_aws_cf-d33f925f6195475daf212fdc8b1919e2-1747407759.yml`](connectors_aws_cf-d33f925f6195475daf212fdc8b1919e2-1747407759.yml) template.
- Run these tests with at least two IAM principals:
    - A principal with full administrative rights (e.g., `AdministratorAccess` policy). The script should ideally "pass" all relevant permission checks for this principal.
    - A principal with intentionally limited rights, designed to fail several permission checks that would be required by the Cortex XDR CFT.
- Analyze the script's output for both scenarios, verifying accuracy of allowed and denied actions.
- Pay attention to performance when processing this large, complex template.

### Acceptance Criteria (AC):
- The script successfully processes the full Cortex XDR CFT without crashing or excessive runtime (define acceptable threshold, e.g., under 5 minutes).
- When run with an administrative principal, the script correctly reports that all (or nearly all, accounting for known limitations) required permissions for the Cortex XDR CFT are allowed.
- When run with a limited principal, the script correctly identifies and reports multiple denied permissions that are critical for the Cortex XDR CFT's deployment.
- The results from these full CFT tests align with expectations based on the principal's permissions and the CFT's requirements.

## Planning & Tracking
- **Task Dependencies**: All preceding implementation tasks (Phases 1-4), as this tests the integrated script. Strategy for managing/mocking IAM principals.
