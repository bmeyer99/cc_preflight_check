# Task Status (DO NOT DELETE)
- **ID**: P5-T1.3
- **Title**: Test with Full Cortex XDR CFT and Varied Principals
- **AssignedTo**: Code
- **From**: P5-Phase5Execution
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Assigned

## Details
### Requirements:
- Utilize the full Cortex XDR CloudFormation template: [`connectors_aws_cf-d33f925f6195475daf212fdc8b1919e2-1747407759.yml`](connectors_aws_cf-d33f925f6195475daf212fdc8b1919e2-1747407759.yml).
- Define two IAM principal scenarios for testing with this full CFT:
    1.  **Admin Principal:** A principal (or its policy document) that possesses all necessary permissions to successfully deploy the Cortex XDR CFT. The pre-flight check should pass.
    2.  **Limited Principal:** A principal (or its policy document) that intentionally lacks a few key permissions required by the Cortex XDR CFT. The pre-flight check should fail, identifying these specific missing permissions.
- If using the mock-based testing approach from P5-T1.2, adapt it to handle the full CFT and these principal definitions.
- Execute the `cc_preflight.py` script against the Cortex XDR CFT using both the "admin" and "limited" principal scenarios.
    - Ensure appropriate parameters for the Cortex XDR CFT are provided to the script during execution (e.g., `DeployCentralLogging`, `ExternalId`, etc., using sensible defaults or placeholders if actual values are not critical for the permission check itself).
- Capture the script's output (stdout, stderr, and exit code) for both scenarios.
- Analyze the output to verify:
    - The "admin" principal scenario results in a successful pre-flight check (all relevant actions allowed).
    - The "limited" principal scenario results in a failed pre-flight check, and the script correctly identifies the intentionally missing permissions.
- Document the test execution process, principal ARNs/policy details used, command-line arguments, expected outcomes, and actual outcomes.

### Acceptance Criteria (AC):
- The Cortex XDR CFT is tested with both "admin" and "limited" IAM principal scenarios.
- The `cc_preflight.py` script correctly passes the check for the "admin" principal.
- The `cc_preflight.py` script correctly fails the check for the "limited" principal and accurately reports the missing permissions.
- The test results, including script output and analysis, are documented in the integration test report (e.g., `/workspace/test_results/integration_test_report.md`, appending to the report from P5-T1.2).
- Any new discrepancies or bugs found in `cc_preflight.py` are documented.
- The task file [`tasks/P5-T1.3-TestWithFullCortexXDRCFT.md`](tasks/P5-T1.3-TestWithFullCortexXDRCFT.md:1) is updated with the outcome and status.

## Planning
- **Dependencies**: P5-T1.2 (Run Integration Tests with Varied Principals), [`connectors_aws_cf-d33f925f6195475daf212fdc8b1919e2-1747407759.yml`](connectors_aws_cf-d33f925f6195475daf212fdc8b1919e2-1747407759.yml)
- **Effort**: Medium
- **Start Date**: 2025-05-16 22:08
- **End Date**: TBD

## Documentation
### Outcome/Summary:
[To be completed by Code mode]

### Issues/Blockers:
- [2025-05-16 22:08] - Task assigned.

### Files:
- Updated test execution logs/scripts.
- Updated summary report of test results in `/workspace/test_results/integration_test_report.md`.
- Potentially, IAM policy JSON files for the "admin" and "limited" test principals.
