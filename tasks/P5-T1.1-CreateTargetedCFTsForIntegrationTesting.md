# Task Status (DO NOT DELETE)
- **ID**: P5-T1.1
- **Title**: Create Targeted CFTs for Integration Testing
- **AssignedTo**: Code
- **From**: P5-Phase5Execution
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Completed

## Details
### Requirements:
- Design and create a suite of small, focused CloudFormation templates (CFTs).
- Each CFT should target specific aspects to test the pre-flight check script's capabilities, including:
    - **Resource Types:** Individual common AWS resource types (e.g., `AWS::IAM::Role`, `AWS::S3::Bucket`, `AWS::Lambda::Function`, `AWS::SQS::Queue`, `AWS::SNS::Topic`, `AWS::KMS::Key`).
    - **Intrinsic Functions:** Test cases for `!Ref`, `!Sub` (string and list forms), `!Join`, `!GetAtt`, `!Equals` (within conditions).
    - **IAM Permission Scenarios:** Templates that require specific, non-obvious IAM permissions for creation or configuration.
    - **Conditions:** CFTs that use the `Conditions` block and conditional resource creation.
    - **Tagging:** Resources with and without tags.
    - **Properties Requiring Specific Actions:** e.g., S3 bucket policies, IAM role inline policies, Lambda environment variables that might reference other resources.
- The CFTs should be simple enough to clearly demonstrate the tested feature.
- Store these CFTs in a dedicated directory, e.g., `/workspace/test_cfts/`.

### Acceptance Criteria (AC):
- A minimum of 10-15 targeted CFTs are created.
- Each CFT is well-documented (comments within the template) explaining what it's designed to test.
- CFTs cover a diverse range of resource types and intrinsic functions relevant to the pre-flight script.
- CFTs are syntactically valid CloudFormation.
- The created CFTs are committed to the repository in the `/workspace/test_cfts/` directory.

## Planning
- **Dependencies**: None (relies on understanding of CFTs and script capabilities)
- **Effort**: Medium
- **Start Date**: 2025-05-16 21:47
- **End Date**: 2025-05-16 21:53

## Documentation
### Outcome/Summary:
Created 13 targeted CloudFormation templates (CFTs) for integration testing of the pre-flight check script. Each template focuses on testing specific aspects of the script's capabilities:

1. IAM Role resources and policies
2. S3 Bucket resources and bucket policies
3. Lambda Function resources and IAM role references
4. SQS and SNS resources and their policies
5. KMS Key resources and aliases
6. CloudFormation intrinsic functions (Ref, Sub, Join, GetAtt)
7. CloudFormation conditions and conditional resource creation
8. CloudTrail resources and cross-service permissions
9. CloudFormation StackSet resources
10. Custom resources and their Lambda handlers
11. Complex IAM permission scenarios
12. Resource tagging across different resource types
13. Properties requiring specific IAM actions

All templates are well-documented with comments explaining what they're designed to test. They cover a diverse range of resource types and intrinsic functions relevant to the pre-flight script, and are syntactically valid CloudFormation.
