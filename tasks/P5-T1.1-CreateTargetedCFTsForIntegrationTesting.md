## Task Identification
- **Task #**: P5-T1.1
- **Task Title**: Create Targeted CFTs for Integration Testing
- **Task Assigned to**: Code Mode
- **Task Assigned from**: Architect Mode (Task 1.1.1)
- **Task Priority**: High
- **Task Status**: Assigned

## Task Details
### Requirements:
- Develop a set of small, targeted CloudFormation templates (CFTs).
- Each test CFT should be designed to specifically test:
    - Particular resource types relevant to the Cortex XDR CFT.
    - Specific intrinsic functions (e.g., `!Ref`, `!Sub` with nesting, `!Join`, `!GetAtt`, conditions, `!Select`).
    - Various IAM permission scenarios (e.g., a template that should pass with certain permissions, and fail with others).
    - Edge cases or complex interactions identified during development.
- These test CFTs will serve as input for integration tests.

### Acceptance Criteria (AC):
- A suite of at least 5-10 small, focused CFTs is created and stored in a dedicated test directory.
- Each test CFT has a clear purpose documented (e.g., in comments within the CFT or a separate manifest file).
- The test CFTs collectively cover a significant range of resource types, intrinsic functions, and IAM scenarios relevant to the script's capabilities and the Cortex XDR CFT.
- The CFTs are valid CloudFormation templates.

## Planning & Tracking
- **Task Dependencies**: Requires a good understanding of all features implemented in Phases 1-4.
