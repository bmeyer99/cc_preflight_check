## Task Identification
- **Task #**: P3-T3.1
- **Task Title**: Refine `iam:PassRole` Handling and Simulation
- **Task Assigned to**: Code Mode
- **Task Assigned from**: Architect Mode (Task 1.1.1)
- **Task Priority**: High
- **Task Status**: Assigned

## Task Details
### Requirements:
- Review and enhance the script's logic for checking `iam:PassRole` permissions.
- For every instance in the [`connectors_aws_cf-d33f925f6195475daf212fdc8b1919e2-1747407759.yml`](connectors_aws_cf-d33f925f6195475daf212fdc8b1919e2-1747407759.yml) template where a role is passed to an AWS service (e.g., Lambda's `Role` property, CloudTrail's `RoleArn` for CWL):
    - Ensure the `iam:PassRole` action is checked against the correct role ARN being passed (this role might be created in the same template or be an existing one).
    - Ensure the simulation context for `iam:PassRole` correctly reflects the service principal that will be assuming/using the role (e.g., `lambda.amazonaws.com`, `cloudtrail.amazonaws.com`). This might involve adding `iam:AssociatedResourceArn` or similar to the `ContextEntries` if applicable and supported by `iam:SimulatePrincipalPolicy` for `iam:PassRole`.
- Focus specifically on the execution roles for `CortexTemplateCustomLambdaFunction` and `EmptyBucketLambda` as mentioned in the project plan.

### Acceptance Criteria (AC):
- The script accurately identifies all `iam:PassRole` scenarios in the Cortex XDR CFT.
- For each `iam:PassRole` scenario, the simulation correctly targets the specific role ARN being passed.
- The simulation for `iam:PassRole` includes appropriate context (e.g., service principal) to accurately reflect the conditions under which `iam:PassRole` is evaluated by AWS.
- `iam:PassRole` checks for `CortexTemplateCustomLambdaFunction` and `EmptyBucketLambda` execution roles are demonstrably robust.
- The script provides clear output regarding `iam:PassRole` checks, indicating success or failure and the specific role/service involved.

## Planning & Tracking
- **Task Dependencies**: Robust `!Ref` and `!GetAtt` resolution (Phase 1 & 2) to correctly identify the ARN of the role being passed. Understanding of how service principals are specified in `iam:PassRole` contexts.
