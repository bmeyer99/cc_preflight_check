## Task Identification
- **Task #**: P5-T2.1
- **Task Title**: Code Refactoring and Optimization
- **Task Assigned to**: Code Mode
- **Task Assigned from**: Architect Mode (Task 1.1.1)
- **Task Priority**: Medium
- **Task Status**: Assigned

## Task Details
### Requirements:
- Conduct a thorough review of the entire Python script codebase.
- Identify areas for improvement in terms of:
    - Clarity and readability (e.g., variable names, function structures, comments).
    - Efficiency (e.g., optimizing loops, reducing redundant computations, improving algorithm performance in template parsing or action collection).
    - Adherence to Python best practices (PEP 8, idiomatic Python).
- Refactor the code as necessary to address the identified areas.
- Specifically look for performance bottlenecks, especially in template parsing and the action collection loop, and attempt to optimize them.

### Acceptance Criteria (AC):
- The codebase is reviewed, and specific areas for refactoring related to clarity, efficiency, or best practices are identified and documented.
- Refactoring changes are implemented and committed.
- Key performance bottlenecks (if any were significant) are addressed, and any measurable improvements are noted.
- The overall codebase is more maintainable, readable, and adheres more closely to Python best practices.
- Code complexity metrics (e.g., cyclomatic complexity for key functions) are reasonable.

## Planning & Tracking
- **Task Dependencies**: A relatively feature-complete version of the script.
