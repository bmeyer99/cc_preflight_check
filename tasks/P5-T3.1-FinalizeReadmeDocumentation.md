# Task Status (DO NOT DELETE)
- **ID**: P5-T3.1
- **Title**: Finalize README.md Documentation
- **AssignedTo**: Code
- **From**: P5-Phase5Execution
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Completed

## Details
### Requirements:
- Thoroughly review the existing [`README.md`](README.md:1) file.
- Update the README to include comprehensive information about all features implemented and changes made throughout Phases 1-5 of the project. This includes, but is not limited to:
    - **Overview:** Purpose and core functionality of the `cc_preflight.py` script.
    - **Features:**
        - Resolution of intrinsic functions (`Ref`, `Fn::Sub`, `Fn::GetAtt`, `Fn::Join`).
        - Handling of CloudFormation `Conditions` (including `Fn::Equals` and CLI input via `--condition-values`).
        - Use of `RESOURCE_ACTION_MAP` for mapping resources to IAM actions.
        - ARN construction and pseudo-parameter resolution.
        - Prerequisite checking.
        - IAM permission simulation.
    - **Usage:**
        - Detailed explanation of all command-line arguments for `cc_preflight.py` (e.g., `--template-file`, `--deploying-principal-arn`, `--region`, `--parameters`, `--profile`, `--condition-values`).
        - Example command invocations.
        - Explanation of the script's output (actions, ARNs, simulation results).
    - **Limitations:**
        - Clearly document any known limitations (e.g., partial support for complex `Fn::Sub` list forms or certain conditional functions like `Fn::And`, `Fn::Or` if not fully implemented).
        - Mention the mock-based approach for IAM principal testing if real AWS interaction is not part of the script's direct execution flow for testing.
        - Limitations in custom resource permission analysis.
    - **Extending the Tool:**
        - Guidance on how to add support for new AWS resource types (updating [`resource_map.py`](resource_map.py:1)).
        - How to improve or add more detailed intrinsic function resolution in [`value_resolver.py`](value_resolver.py:1).
    - **Prerequisites/Setup:** Any necessary setup steps for running the script (e.g., Python version, `boto3` installation, AWS credentials configuration).
- Ensure the README is well-structured, clearly written, and easy for a new user to understand.
- Use appropriate Markdown formatting for readability.

### Acceptance Criteria (AC):
- The [`README.md`](README.md:1) is updated to be comprehensive and accurately reflects the tool's current state.
- All new features, CLI parameters, and functionalities are documented.
- Known limitations are clearly stated.
- Guidance for extension is provided.
- The README is well-organized and easy to read.
- The task file [`tasks/P5-T3.1-FinalizeReadmeDocumentation.md`](tasks/P5-T3.1-FinalizeReadmeDocumentation.md:1) is updated with the outcome and status.

## Planning
- **Dependencies**: P5-T2.2 (Optimize Performance) - implies codebase features are stable.
- **Effort**: Medium
- **Start Date**: 2025-05-16 22:37
- **End Date**: TBD

## Documentation
### Outcome/Summary:
I've completely revised and updated the README.md file to provide comprehensive documentation of the CloudFormation Pre-flight Check Tool. The updated documentation includes:

1. A clear overview of the tool's purpose and core functionality
2. Detailed explanation of all implemented features:
   - Intrinsic function resolution (Ref, Fn::Sub, Fn::GetAtt, Fn::Join)
   - Condition handling and evaluation
   - Resource-to-action mapping via RESOURCE_ACTION_MAP
   - ARN construction and pseudo-parameter resolution
   - Prerequisite checking
   - IAM permission simulation

3. Complete usage instructions including:
   - Prerequisites and setup
   - All command-line arguments with explanations
   - Example commands for various scenarios
   - Output interpretation guide

4. Known limitations of the tool, including:
   - Intrinsic function resolution limitations
   - Condition evaluation limitations
   - IAM simulation accuracy considerations
   - CloudFormation StackSet and Custom Resource limitations

5. Guidance on extending the tool:
   - Adding support for new resource types
   - Improving intrinsic function resolution
   - Adding new prerequisite checks

The documentation is well-structured with clear headings, code examples, and explanations that make it easy for users to understand and use the tool effectively.
