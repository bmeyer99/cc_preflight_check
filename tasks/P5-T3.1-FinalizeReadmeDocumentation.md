# Task Status Template (DO NOT DELETE THIS)

## Task Identification
- **Task #**: P5-T3.1
- **Task Title**: Finalize README.md and Inline Documentation
- **Task Assigned to**: Code Mode (Documentation focused)
- **Task Assigned from**: Architect Mode (Task 1.1.1)
- **Task Priority**: High
- **Task Status**: Assigned

## Task Details
### Requirements:
- Update the main [`README.md`](README.md) file for the script.
- Ensure the [`README.md`](README.md) comprehensively covers:
    - All new features added throughout Phases 1-4.
    - All command-line parameters and their usage (including new ones for condition values, context keys, external action maps, output formats).
    - Known limitations of the script (e.g., StackSet cross-account simulation, custom resource internal logic, `!ImportValue` without mocks).
    - Clear instructions on how to run the script.
    - Guidance on how to extend or customize the script (e.g., using an external `RESOURCE_ACTION_MAP`).
- Review and enhance inline code comments throughout the script. Ensure all functions, complex logic blocks, and non-obvious code sections have clear explanations.

### Acceptance Criteria (AC):
- The [`README.md`](README.md) is up-to-date and accurately reflects all features, parameters, and known limitations of the final script.
- The [`README.md`](README.md) is well-organized, easy to understand, and provides sufficient information for a new user to effectively use the script.
- Inline code comments are present for all major functions and complex logic sections, explaining the "why" and "how."
- The documentation is considered comprehensive and user-friendly.

## Planning & Tracking
- **Task Dependencies**: Completion of all feature implementation and previous documentation tasks (e.g., P4-T2.3, P4-T3.2).
