## Task Identification
- **Task #**: P4-T3.2
- **Task Title**: Document Limitation of Custom Resource Internal Logic Validation
- **Task Assigned to**: Code Mode (Documentation task)
- **Task Assigned from**: Architect Mode (Task 1.1.1)
- **Task Priority**: Medium
- **Task Status**: Assigned

## Task Details
### Requirements:
- Clearly state in the script's [`README.md`](README.md) or other user-facing documentation that the pre-flight check script *does not* validate the internal logic of custom resource Lambda functions.
- For example, explain that it won't verify if the Lambda function code for `CortexTemplateCustomLambdaFunction` can successfully make an external HTTP PUT request or perform other custom actions.
- Clarify that the pre-flight check for Custom Resources focuses on the deploying principal's ability to set up the *framework* for the custom resource: the `AWS::Lambda::Function` itself, its `AWS::IAM::Role` (execution role), and the `iam:PassRole` permission.

### Acceptance Criteria (AC):
- The [`README.md`](README.md) or other primary documentation for the script contains a clear section explaining that the internal logic of custom resource Lambda functions is not validated by the script.
- The documentation accurately describes that the script's checks for custom resources are limited to the setup of the Lambda function, its execution role, and associated permissions.
- The example of the `CortexTemplateCustomLambdaFunction`'s external HTTP PUT is used or a similar illustrative example is provided to make the limitation clear.

## Planning & Tracking
