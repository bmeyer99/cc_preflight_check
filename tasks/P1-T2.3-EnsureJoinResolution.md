# Task Status Template (DO NOT DELETE THIS)

## Task Identification
- **Task #**: P1-T2.3
- **Task Title**: Ensure `!Join` Correctly Resolves Nested Functions
- **Task Assigned to**: Code Mode
- **Task Assigned from**: Architect Mode (Task 1.1.1)
- **Task Priority**: High
- **Task Status**: Completed

## Task Details
### Requirements:
- Modify the `resolve_value` function (or equivalent logic) in the Python script.
- Ensure that the `!Join` intrinsic function correctly resolves any nested intrinsic functions for each element in its list of items *before* performing the join operation.

### Acceptance Criteria (AC):
- The `resolve_value` function accurately processes `!Join` by first resolving all intrinsic functions within each element of the list to be joined.
- The final string produced by `!Join` reflects the correctly resolved values of any nested functions.
- The script can successfully process `!Join` examples from the [`connectors_aws_cf-d33f925f6195475daf212fdc8b1919e2-1747407759.yml`](connectors_aws_cf-d33f925f6195475daf212fdc8b1919e2-1747407759.yml) template, especially those containing nested intrinsic functions.
- Existing `!Join` functionality for simple lists of strings is not regressed.

## Planning & Tracking
- **Task Dependencies**: P1-T2.1, P1-T2.2 (as `!Join` might contain `!Ref` or `!Sub` that need prior enhancement)

## Documentation
### Task Outcome & Summary
Reviewed the `resolve_value` function in [`cc_preflight.py`](cc_preflight.py). Found that the existing implementation for `Fn::Join` (lines 318-322) already meets the requirements of this task. It correctly extracts the delimiter and the list to join, and recursively calls `resolve_value` on each item in the list before joining them. Therefore, no code modifications were necessary. The task is completed as the required functionality was already present.

### Task Issues & Blockers
- None. The existing code already satisfied the requirements.
