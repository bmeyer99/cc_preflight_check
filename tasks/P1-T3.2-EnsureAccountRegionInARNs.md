## Task Identification
- **Task #**: P1-T3.2
- **Task Title**: Ensure Account ID and Region are Correctly Applied in ARN Patterns
- **Task Assigned to**: Code Mode
- **Task Assigned from**: Architect Mode (Task 1.1.1)
- **Task Priority**: Medium
- **Task Status**: Assigned

## Task Details
### Requirements:
- Review and update the ARN generation logic within the Python script (specifically how `arn_patterns` from `RESOURCE_ACTION_MAP` are processed or how ARNs are constructed).
- Ensure that the AWS Account ID and Region are correctly and consistently incorporated into all generated ARN patterns used for simulation.
- This may involve verifying how these values are obtained (e.g., from user input, environment variables, or AWS SDK calls if appropriate for pre-flight context) and how they are substituted into ARN templates.

### Acceptance Criteria (AC):
- All ARN patterns generated by the script for simulation purposes correctly include placeholders or actual values for AWS Account ID and Region.
- The mechanism for incorporating Account ID and Region into ARNs is robust and consistently applied across all relevant resource types.
- Logic for obtaining/using Account ID and Region is clearly documented within the script.

## Planning & Tracking
- **Task Dependencies**: P1-T1.3, P1-T3.1 (as this task refines `arn_patterns` and their processing)
