# Task Status (DO NOT DELETE)
- **ID**: P2-T2.1
- **Title**: Allow Condition Input Values and Basic Structure
- **AssignedTo**: AI
- **From**: Orchestrator
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Completed
## Details
### Requirements:
- Modify `cc_preflight.py` to accept a representation of condition values as input.
- Establish the basic structure for storing and accessing these input condition values.
- Lay the groundwork for a function that will evaluate conditions defined in a template's `Conditions` block.
### Acceptance Criteria (AC):
- The script can receive condition values (e.g., as a dictionary/JSON).
- The script stores these values accessibly.
- A stub function `evaluate_condition` exists that can look up a condition name in the input values and return its boolean state, defaulting to `False` if not found.
- The task file `tasks/P2-T2.1-AllowConditionInputValues.md` is updated with status and outcome.
## Planning
- **Dependencies**: P2-T1.2 (Implicit, builds on core resolution logic)
- **Effort**: Medium
- **Start Date**: 2023-10-27 10:00
- **End Date**: 2023-10-27 14:00
## Documentation
### Outcome/Summary:
Implemented the ability to accept condition input values via a `--condition-values` CLI argument in JSON format. Added a basic structure to store these values in the `context` dictionary passed to the `parse_template_and_collect_actions` function. Created a stub function `evaluate_condition` that looks up a condition name in the provided input values, returning the boolean state if found, and defaulting to `False` otherwise. This lays the groundwork for evaluating conditions in subsequent tasks.
### Issues/Blockers:
- [2025-05-16 19:59] - Indentation issues were introduced in `cc_preflight.py` during the `apply_diff` process, leading to Pylance errors. These need to be corrected in the next task (P2-T2.2).
