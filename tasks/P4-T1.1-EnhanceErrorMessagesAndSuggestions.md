## Task Identification
- **Task #**: P4-T1.1
- **Task Title**: Enhance Error Messages and Suggestions in Reporting
- **Task Assigned to**: Code Mode
- **Task Assigned from**: Architect Mode (Task 1.1.1)
- **Task Priority**: Medium
- **Task Status**: Assigned

## Task Details
### Requirements:
- Review the script's current output and error reporting mechanisms.
- Enhance error messages to be more detailed and user-friendly.
- Where an IAM action is denied during simulation, attempt to provide suggestions for missing permissions if possible (e.g., "Action S3:GetObject on Resource arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket/* denied. Consider adding s3:GetObject for this resource to the deploying principal's policy."). This might involve:
    - Mapping denied actions to common policy statements.
    - Suggesting the specific action and resource that was denied.
- The level of suggestion should be practical for pre-flight analysis (not overly complex AI-driven policy generation).

### Acceptance Criteria (AC):
- Error messages related to IAM simulation failures are more descriptive, clearly indicating the action, resource, and decision (denied).
- For denied actions, the script provides a basic, actionable suggestion to the user regarding the permission that might be missing.
- The output clearly distinguishes between different types of failures (e.g., explicit deny, implicit deny due to no matching allow).
- User feedback indicates that the enhanced error messages and suggestions are helpful in diagnosing permission issues.

## Planning & Tracking
- **Task Dependencies**: Relies on the output structure of the IAM simulation results.
