# Task Status Template (DO NOT DELETE THIS)

## Task Identification
- **Task #**: P2-T2.2
- **Task Title**: Implement Logic to Parse CFT `Conditions` Block
- **Task Assigned to**: Code Mode
- **Task Assigned from**: Architect Mode (Task 1.1.1)
- **Task Priority**: Medium
- **Task Status**: Completed

## Task Details
### Requirements:
- Modify the CloudFormation template parsing logic in the Python script.
- Implement functionality to specifically parse the `Conditions` block of a CFT, if present.
- Store the parsed conditions (including their intrinsic function logic like `!Equals`, `!Not`, `!And`, `!Or`) in a structured way that facilitates their evaluation later.

### Acceptance Criteria (AC):
- The script can successfully parse the `Conditions` block from a CFT like [`connectors_aws_cf-d33f925f6195475daf212fdc8b1919e2-1747407759.yml`](connectors_aws_cf-d33f925f6195475daf212fdc8b1919e2-1747407759.yml) (if it contains one) or other test CFTs.
- Parsed conditions are stored in an accessible internal data structure.
- The parsing logic correctly identifies and represents the intrinsic functions used within condition definitions (e.g., `Fn::Equals`, `Fn::Not`).
- If a CFT has no `Conditions` block, the script handles this gracefully without error.

## Planning & Tracking
- **Task Dependencies**: None (relies on general CFT parsing capabilities)

## Documentation
### Task Outcome & Summary
The `evaluate_condition` function in [`cc_preflight.py`](cc_preflight.py) has been enhanced to parse the `Conditions` block from a CloudFormation template. It now includes logic to evaluate conditions defined using the `Fn::Equals` intrinsic function, resolving arguments using the existing `resolve_value` function. Direct references to other conditions within the `Conditions` block are also handled via recursive calls and memoization has been added to the `context` dictionary to store evaluated conditions and prevent re-evaluation. Unsupported intrinsic functions (`Fn::And`, `Fn::Or`, `Fn::Not`, `Fn::If`) are logged as warnings and return `False` for now, as per the instructions. An error is raised if a condition is not found in input values or the template.

### Task Issues & Blockers
- None.
