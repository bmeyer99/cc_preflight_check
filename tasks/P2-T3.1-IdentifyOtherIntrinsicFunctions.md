- **Task Assigned from**: Architect Mode (Task 1.1.1)
- **Task Priority**: Low
- **Task Status**: Assigned

## Task Details
### Requirements:
- Review the [`connectors_aws_cf-d33f925f6195475daf212fdc8b1919e2-1747407759.yml`](connectors_aws_cf-d33f925f6195475daf212fdc8b1919e2-1747407759.yml) template to identify any usage of less common intrinsic functions beyond `!Ref`, `!Sub`, `!Join`, and `!GetAtt`.
- Research commonly found CloudFormation intrinsic functions that are not yet supported by the script (e.g., `!Select`, `!Split`, `!FindInMap`, `!ImportValue`).
- Prioritize which of these functions would provide the most value for improving the accuracy of the pre-flight check, especially concerning the Cortex XDR CFT.
- Document the identified functions and their typical usage patterns.

### Acceptance Criteria (AC):
- A list of additional intrinsic functions used in the Cortex XDR CFT (if any) is compiled.
- A prioritized list of other commonly used intrinsic functions (e.g., `!Select`, `!Split`, `!FindInMap`, `!ImportValue`) is documented, along with their typical syntax and behavior.
- For each identified function, a brief assessment of its relevance to the Cortex XDR CFT and the effort required for basic implementation is provided.
