## Task Identification
- **Task #**: P2-T2.4
- **Task Title**: Skip Action Collection for Resources with False Conditions
- **Task Assigned to**: Code Mode
- **Task Assigned from**: Architect Mode (Task 1.1.1)
- **Task Priority**: High
- **Task Status**: Assigned

## Task Details
### Requirements:
- Modify the main script logic that iterates through resources to collect IAM actions.
- If a resource has an associated `Condition` (identified by its `Condition` key), and that condition evaluates to `false` (based on logic from Task P2-T2.3):
    - The script should skip collecting IAM actions for that specific resource.
    - The script should also skip collecting IAM actions for any properties of that resource.
- If a resource has no `Condition` key, or if its condition evaluates to `true`, action collection should proceed as normal.

### Acceptance Criteria (AC):
- When a resource's associated condition evaluates to `false`, no IAM actions are collected or simulated for that resource or its properties.
- The script correctly distinguishes between resources with true conditions, false conditions, and no conditions, applying the action collection logic appropriately.
- This behavior is demonstrable with test CFTs containing conditional resources.
- A log message or notification is generated indicating when a resource is skipped due to a false condition.

## Planning & Tracking
- **Task Dependencies**: P2-T2.3 (relies on the output of condition evaluation)
