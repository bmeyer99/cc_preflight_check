## Task Identification
- **Task #**: P5-T4.1
- **Task Title**: Review and Enhance Error Handling and Edge Case Management
- **Task Assigned to**: Code Mode
- **Task Assigned from**: Architect Mode (Task 1.1.1)
- **Task Priority**: Medium
- **Task Status**: Assigned

## Task Details
### Requirements:
- Conduct a comprehensive review of the script's error handling mechanisms.
- Ensure robustness in handling potential issues such as:
    - Malformed CloudFormation templates (e.g., incorrect YAML/JSON syntax, missing required sections).
    - Invalid or unexpected parameter values provided to the script.
    - Invalid ARNs encountered in templates or parameters.
    - Potential AWS API errors if live calls are made (e.g., for `iam:SimulatePrincipalPolicy` or prerequisite checks), including appropriate retries or graceful failure.
- Consider and test edge cases in template structures or content, such as:
    - Empty resource blocks (e.g., `Resources: {}`).
    - Unusual parameter types or default values.
    - Extremely large templates or those with deeply nested intrinsic functions.
- Implement improvements to error handling to ensure the script fails gracefully with informative messages rather than crashing.

### Acceptance Criteria (AC):
- The script demonstrates robust error handling for common issues like malformed CFTs, invalid input parameters, and problematic ARNs.
- If AWS API calls are made, they include basic error handling (e.g., catching common exceptions like `ClientError`).
- The script handles identified edge cases gracefully, either by processing them correctly or by providing clear error messages about unsupported structures.
- User-facing error messages are clear, informative, and help diagnose the issue.
- The script does not crash due to unexpected input or template structures within the scope of what it's designed to handle.

## Planning & Tracking
- **Task Dependencies**: A feature-complete script to test against.
