## Task Identification
- **Task #**: P4-T1.3
- **Task Title**: Distinguish Between Simulation Result Types in Output
- **Task Assigned to**: Code Mode
- **Task Assigned from**: Architect Mode (Task 1.1.1)
- **Task Priority**: Medium
- **Task Status**: Assigned

## Task Details
### Requirements:
- Enhance the script's reporting logic to clearly differentiate between various simulation outcomes for IAM permissions.
- Specifically, the output (text, JSON, HTML) should distinguish between:
    - "Definitely denied": Simulation explicitly returned a deny (e.g., due to an explicit Deny statement).
    - "Conditionally denied / Potentially denied": Simulation denied, but the result might change if specific IAM context keys were provided (e.g., a deny that could be an allow if `aws:SourceIp` was set). This requires identifying if the policy evaluation involved condition keys that were not supplied by the user.
    - "Allowed with wildcards": Simulation allowed, but the permission was granted due to a wildcard in the principal's policy or the resource ARN used in simulation, indicating a less precise check.
    - "Allowed (specific)": Simulation allowed with specific resource matching and no broad wildcards.

### Acceptance Criteria (AC):
- The script's output (across all supported formats) clearly categorizes permission simulation results using terms like "Definitely Denied," "Conditionally Denied," "Allowed (Wildcard)," "Allowed (Specific)," or similar unambiguous labels.
- The logic for determining "Conditionally Denied" correctly identifies when missing context keys (that were part of the evaluated policy statements) might have influenced the outcome.
- The logic for identifying "Allowed with wildcards" correctly flags simulations where broad wildcards in policies or simulated ARNs were pivotal to the allow decision.
- Users find these distinctions helpful in understanding the nuances of the simulation results.

## Planning & Tracking
- **Task Dependencies**: P3-T1.2 (user input for context keys), P3-T1.3 (auto-derivation of context keys), and detailed results from `iam:SimulatePrincipalPolicy` (specifically, how it reports evaluation details involving conditions).
