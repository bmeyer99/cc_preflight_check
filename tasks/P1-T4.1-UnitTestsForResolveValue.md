# Task Status Template (DO NOT DELETE THIS)

## Task Identification
- **Task #**: P1-T4.1
- **Task Title**: Implement Unit Tests for `resolve_value()`
- **Task Assigned to**: Code Mode
- **Task Assigned from**: Architect Mode (Task 1.1.1)
- **Task Priority**: High
- **Task Status**: Completed

## Task Details
### Requirements:
- Implement a suite of unit tests for the `resolve_value()` function (or its equivalent) in the Python script.
- Test cases should cover various intrinsic functions, including:
    - `!Ref` (to parameters, globals, and logical resource IDs).
    - `!Sub` (simple string form, list form, and with nested functions).
    - `!Join` (with simple lists and lists containing nested functions).
- Include tests for both valid and potentially edge-case inputs to ensure robustness.

### Acceptance Criteria (AC):
- A comprehensive set of unit tests for `resolve_value()` is created using a suitable Python testing framework (e.g., PyTest, unittest).
- Test coverage for `resolve_value()` specifically addresses `!Ref`, `!Sub`, and `!Join` functionalities as implemented/enhanced in Tasks P1-T2.1, P1-T2.2, and P1-T2.3.
- All implemented unit tests pass successfully.
- The test suite is well-organized and easy to run.

## Planning & Tracking
- **Task Dependencies**: P1-T2.1, P1-T2.2, P1-T2.3 (as tests will validate the functionality implemented in these tasks)

## Documentation
### Task Outcome & Summary
Unit tests for the `resolve_value` function in [`cc_preflight.py`](cc_preflight.py) have been developed and added to [`test_cc_preflight.py`](test_cc_preflight.py). The tests cover the following scenarios:
- `Ref` resolution for parameters (with and without defaults), logical resource IDs, and AWS pseudo-parameters (`AWS::Partition`, `AWS::Region`, `AWS::AccountId`, `AWS::StackName`, `AWS::StackId`, `AWS::URLSuffix`, `AWS::NoValue`).
- `Fn::Sub` (single string form) resolution for strings with no variables, parameter references, logical resource ID references, AWS pseudo-parameter references, multiple references, literal dollars, and undefined variables. The behavior for undefined variables is to substitute with a placeholder `UNRESOLVED_SUB_VAR_VariableName`.
- `Fn::Join` resolution for lists of literal strings, lists containing `Ref` to parameters, logical resource IDs, and AWS pseudo-parameters, lists containing simple `Fn::Sub`, lists with mixed items, empty lists, and lists with a single item. Handling of `AWS::NoValue` resolving to `None` within `Fn::Join` is also tested.
- Nested intrinsic functions, including `Fn::Sub` containing `Ref` and `Fn::Join` containing `Ref` and `Fn::Sub`.
- Resolution of plain string values.
- Handling of lists and dictionaries containing resolvable values.

### Task Issues & Blockers
