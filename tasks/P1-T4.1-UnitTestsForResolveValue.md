## Task Identification
- **Task #**: P1-T4.1
- **Task Title**: Implement Unit Tests for `resolve_value()`
- **Task Assigned to**: Code Mode
- **Task Assigned from**: Architect Mode (Task 1.1.1)
- **Task Priority**: High
- **Task Status**: Assigned

## Task Details
### Requirements:
- Implement a suite of unit tests for the `resolve_value()` function (or its equivalent) in the Python script.
- Test cases should cover various intrinsic functions, including:
    - `!Ref` (to parameters, globals, and logical resource IDs).
    - `!Sub` (simple string form, list form, and with nested functions).
    - `!Join` (with simple lists and lists containing nested functions).
- Include tests for both valid and potentially edge-case inputs to ensure robustness.

### Acceptance Criteria (AC):
- A comprehensive set of unit tests for `resolve_value()` is created using a suitable Python testing framework (e.g., PyTest, unittest).
- Test coverage for `resolve_value()` specifically addresses `!Ref`, `!Sub`, and `!Join` functionalities as implemented/enhanced in Tasks P1-T2.1, P1-T2.2, and P1-T2.3.
- All implemented unit tests pass successfully.
- The test suite is well-organized and easy to run.

## Planning & Tracking
- **Task Dependencies**: P1-T2.1, P1-T2.2, P1-T2.3 (as tests will validate the functionality implemented in these tasks)
