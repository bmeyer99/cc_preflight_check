## Task Identification
- **Task #**: P3-T1.3
- **Task Title**: Automatically Derive ContextEntries for Simulation
- **Task Assigned to**: Code Mode
- **Task Assigned from**: Architect Mode (Task 1.1.1)
- **Task Priority**: Medium
- **Task Status**: Assigned

## Task Details
### Requirements:
- Enhance the script's logic for preparing `iam:SimulatePrincipalPolicy` calls.
- Implement functionality to automatically derive certain `ContextEntries` where possible and appropriate for pre-flight checks.
- The `sts:ExternalId` is already handled (as per project plan); confirm this and ensure it's robust.
- Investigate and implement logic to derive other context keys if feasible. For example:
    - If a resource's creation triggers another AWS service action (e.g., a Lambda function being invoked by S3), could an `aws:SourceArn` be contextually derived for simulating permissions of the triggered action if that action itself is being simulated? (This might be complex).
    - Consider other common, derivable context keys based on the resources being created or parameters provided.
- User-provided context keys (from Task P3-T1.2) should take precedence over automatically derived ones if there's a conflict for the same key.

### Acceptance Criteria (AC):
- The script automatically includes `sts:ExternalId` in `ContextEntries` if an external ID is provided or relevant to the simulation.
- The script attempts to derive and include other relevant `ContextEntries` (e.g., `aws:SourceArn` in specific, well-defined scenarios) where feasible for pre-flight simulation.
- Documentation is added to explain which context keys are automatically derived and under what conditions.
- User-provided context keys correctly override any automatically derived key if they share the same `ContextKeyName`.
- The impact of auto-derived context keys on simulation accuracy is evaluated and noted.

## Planning & Tracking
- **Task Dependencies**: P3-T1.2 (for interaction with user-provided keys), understanding of specific resource interaction patterns in the CFT.
