## Documentation
### Outcome/Summary:
Phase 5 has been successfully completed, with all planned tasks executed and their objectives achieved. The CloudFormation pre-flight check tool is now thoroughly tested, optimized, well-documented, and robust in handling errors and edge cases. Here's a summary of the work completed:

1. **Integration Testing (P5-T1.x):**
   - Created 13 targeted CloudFormation templates (CFTs) covering various resource types, intrinsic functions, and IAM permission scenarios.
   - Implemented a mock-based testing approach to verify the script's ability to detect sufficient and insufficient permissions.
   - Tested the script against the full Cortex XDR CFT with both admin and limited principal scenarios.
   - Documented test results in comprehensive reports.

2. **Code Refactoring and Optimization (P5-T2.x):**
   - Conducted a thorough code review and improved code structure, organization, and readability.
   - Implemented significant performance optimizations:
     - Added memoization for value resolution using `functools.lru_cache`
     - Implemented CloudFormation YAML tag handlers for proper parsing
     - Added caching for template loading, resource name resolution, and ARN construction
     - Optimized property lookups and tag action checks using set operations
   - Performance testing showed substantial improvements, especially for complex templates.

3. **Documentation (P5-T3.x):**
   - Completely revised and updated the README.md with comprehensive information about the tool's purpose, features, usage, limitations, and extension guides.
   - Enhanced inline documentation throughout the codebase:
     - Added detailed module-level docstrings
     - Improved function/method docstrings with parameter and return value documentation
     - Added explanatory comments for complex logic
     - Ensured consistent documentation style across all files

4. **Error Handling and Edge Cases (P5-T4.x):**
   - Implemented a custom exception hierarchy for better error classification and handling
   - Enhanced input validation for command-line arguments, template structure, and intrinsic functions
   - Added circular dependency detection in resolver functions
   - Improved error handling in AWS API interactions and prerequisite checks
   - Standardized error handling patterns across the codebase
   - Ensured non-zero exit codes for unrecoverable errors
   - Prevented leaking of sensitive information in error messages

The project is now ready for a stable release, with all acceptance criteria met:
- The script has been thoroughly tested through integration tests
- Code has been refactored and optimized
- All documentation (README, inline comments) has been finalized
- Error handling is robust and edge cases are considered
