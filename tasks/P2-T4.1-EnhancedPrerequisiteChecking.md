## Task Identification
- **Task #**: P2-T4.1
- **Task Title**: Expand `check_prerequisites()` for More Robust Validation
- **Task Assigned to**: Code Mode
- **Task Assigned from**: Architect Mode (Task 1.1.1)
- **Task Priority**: Medium
- **Task Status**: Assigned

## Task Details
### Requirements:
- Expand the existing `check_prerequisites()` function (or equivalent logic) in the Python script.
- Implement validation beyond simple IAM role existence.
- For parameters in the CloudFormation template that expect specific resource ARNs (e.g., an S3 bucket ARN for a parameter):
    - Attempt to check if the specified resource (e.g., the S3 bucket) exists. This may require an AWS API call. If direct API calls are problematic for pre-flight, consider making this check optional or allowing mock responses.
    - Attempt to check if the deploying principal (whose permissions are being simulated) has basic access permissions to the specified external resource (e.g., `s3:ListBucket` for an S3 bucket parameter). This would likely involve a targeted `iam:SimulatePrincipalPolicy` call using the deploying principal's context against the provided resource ARN.

### Acceptance Criteria (AC):
- The `check_prerequisites()` function is enhanced to attempt validation of existence and/or accessibility for resources specified by ARN-type parameters.
- If AWS API calls are used for these checks, their usage is clearly documented, and potential implications for pre-flight execution (e.g., requiring credentials, network access) are noted. Consider providing a mechanism to disable or mock these live checks.
- The script outputs informative messages regarding the outcome of these enhanced prerequisite checks (e.g., "Prerequisite S3 Bucket for parameter 'InputBucketARN' found and accessible.", "Warning: Prerequisite S3 Bucket for parameter 'InputBucketARN' not found or deploying principal lacks s3:ListBucket permission.").
- Existing prerequisite checking functionality (e.g., for IAM Role ARNs provided as parameters) is maintained and not regressed.

## Planning & Tracking
- **Task Dependencies**: Understanding of how the deploying principal's context is managed for `iam:SimulatePrincipalPolicy`.
