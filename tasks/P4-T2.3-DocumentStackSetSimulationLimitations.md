## Task Identification
- **Task #**: P4-T2.3
- **Task Title**: Document Limitations of SERVICE_MANAGED StackSet Simulation
- **Task Assigned to**: Code Mode (Documentation task)
- **Task Assigned from**: Architect Mode (Task 1.1.1)
- **Task Priority**: Medium
- **Task Status**: Assigned

## Task Details
### Requirements:
- Clearly document within the script's [`README.md`](README.md) or other user-facing documentation the limitations of simulating permissions for `SERVICE_MANAGED` StackSets.
- Specifically, state that for `SERVICE_MANAGED` StackSets (like `CortexPlatformCloudRoleStackSetMember` with `AutoDeployment: Enabled: 'True'`), the actual cross-account resource creation permissions are handled by AWS Organizations and service-linked roles.
- Explain that the pre-flight check script *cannot* easily or directly simulate these cross-account permissions for the deploying principal.
- Clarify that the script's checks for StackSets will focus on the deploying principal's ability to manage the StackSet resource itself (create, delete, update) and its OU/account targeting within the management account.

### Acceptance Criteria (AC):
- The [`README.md`](README.md) or other primary documentation for the script contains a clear section explaining the limitations of pre-flight checking `SERVICE_MANAGED` StackSets.
- The documentation accurately describes that cross-account permissions for resource creation within member accounts are managed by AWS Organizations/SLRs and are outside the scope of what the script can simulate for the deploying principal.
- The documentation clarifies that the script's StackSet checks pertain to the management of the StackSet entity itself by the deploying principal.

## Planning & Tracking
- **Task Dependencies**: P4-T2.1, P4-T2.2 (understanding of StackSet mechanics and what is being checked)
