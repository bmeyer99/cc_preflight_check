## Task Identification
- **Task #**: P2-T2.3
- **Task Title**: Implement CFT Condition Evaluation Logic
- **Task Assigned to**: Code Mode
- **Task Assigned from**: Architect Mode (Task 1.1.1)
- **Task Priority**: High
- **Task Status**: In Progress

## Task Details
### Requirements:
- Develop logic within the script to evaluate parsed CFT conditions (from Task P2-T2.2).
- The evaluation should use user-provided condition values (from Task P2-T2.1).
- Support evaluation of intrinsic functions commonly used within conditions, such as `!Equals`, `!Not`, `!And`, `!Or`.
- The `resolve_value` function might need to be enhanced or utilized to resolve any `!Ref` or other intrinsic functions present within the condition's definition before final evaluation.
- When processing resources in the CFT, check if they have a `Condition` key. If so, evaluate the named condition.

### Acceptance Criteria (AC):
- The script can correctly evaluate simple conditions based on user-provided input values.
- The script correctly evaluates conditions involving intrinsic functions like `!Equals`, `!Not`, `!And`, `!Or`.
- The evaluation logic correctly resolves any nested intrinsic functions (e.g., `!Ref` to parameters) within a condition's definition before evaluating the condition itself.
- If a resource has a `Condition` key, the script successfully evaluates that condition.
- If a condition cannot be fully evaluated (e.g., missing user input for a referenced parameter within the condition), this is handled gracefully (e.g., warning, default to false, or as defined).

## Planning & Tracking
- **Task Dependencies**: P2-T2.1, P2-T2.2, and potentially enhancements to `resolve_value` from Phase 1 (P1-T2.1, P1-T2.2, P1-T2.3) if conditions reference complex intrinsic functions.
