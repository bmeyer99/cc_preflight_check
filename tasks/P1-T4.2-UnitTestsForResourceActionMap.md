## Task Identification
- **Task #**: P1-T4.2
- **Task Title**: Implement Unit Tests for `RESOURCE_ACTION_MAP` Lookups and Action Aggregation
- **Task Assigned to**: Code Mode
- **Task Assigned from**: Architect Mode (Task 1.1.1)
- **Task Priority**: High
- **Task Status**: Assigned

## Task Details
### Requirements:
- Implement a suite of unit tests for the logic that interacts with `RESOURCE_ACTION_MAP`.
- Test cases should cover:
    - Correct lookup of `generic_actions` for various resource types.
    - Correct lookup and application of `property_actions` based on resource properties.
    - Correct lookup of tagging actions.
    - Accurate aggregation of all applicable actions (generic, property-specific, tagging) for a given resource configuration.
- Include tests for scenarios where mappings might be missing or for edge cases in action aggregation.

### Acceptance Criteria (AC):
- A comprehensive set of unit tests for `RESOURCE_ACTION_MAP` interaction logic is created using a suitable Python testing framework (e.g., PyTest, unittest).
- Test coverage validates the correct retrieval of `generic_actions`, `property_actions`, and tagging actions from the `RESOURCE_ACTION_MAP`.
- Test coverage validates the accurate aggregation of actions from these different sources for a complete resource definition.
- All implemented unit tests pass successfully.
- The test suite is well-organized and easy to run.

## Planning & Tracking
- **Task Dependencies**: P1-T1.3 (as tests will validate the `RESOURCE_ACTION_MAP` structure and content implemented in this task)
