# Task Status (DO NOT DELETE)
- **ID**: P1-T4.2
- **Title**: Develop Unit Tests for RESOURCE_ACTION_MAP
- **AssignedTo**: AI
- **From**: Orchestrator
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Completed
## Details
### Requirements:
- Create unit tests for the `RESOURCE_ACTION_MAP` global variable in `cc_preflight.py`.
- Verify the presence of key resource types as top-level keys.
- Verify the existence of expected operation keys ("Create", "Update", "Delete", "Tag") for key resource types.
- Assert that the list of IAM actions for selected resource type/operation combinations matches the documentation in `tasks/P1-T1.2-IdentifyIAMActions.md`.
- Verify the data structure of `RESOURCE_ACTION_MAP` (dict of dicts of lists of strings).
- Add tests to `test_cc_preflight.py`.
- Update this task file with status and summary.

### Acceptance Criteria (AC):
- Unit tests for `RESOURCE_ACTION_MAP` exist in `test_cc_preflight.py`.
- Tests cover key resource types, operation keys, accurate action lists for a sample, and data structure.
- All tests pass.
- This task file is updated with 'Completed' status and a summary of the work.

## Planning

## Documentation
### Outcome/Summary:
Unit tests for the `RESOURCE_ACTION_MAP` in [`cc_preflight.py`](cc_preflight.py) have been developed and added to [`test_cc_preflight.py`](test_cc_preflight.py). The tests verify the overall dictionary structure, the presence of key resource types as top-level keys, the existence of expected operation keys ("Create", "Update", "Delete", "Tag") for several key resource types, and the accuracy of the IAM action lists for a selection of resource type and operation combinations based on the documentation in [`tasks/P1-T1.2-IdentifyIAMActions.md`](tasks/P1-T1.2-IdentifyIAMActions.md).

### Issues/Blockers:
- None.
