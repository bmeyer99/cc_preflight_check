# Task Status (DO NOT DELETE)
- **ID**: P5-T5.2
- **Title**: Remediate Discrepancies Between Task Documentation and Code Implementation
- **AssignedTo**: Cody/Code
- **From**: P5-T5.1-VerifyCompletionConsistencyTestability
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Completed

## Details
### Requirements:
- Implement missing condition handling logic as described in tasks P2-T2.1 and P2-T2.2
- Align Fn::GetAtt implementation with the detailed placeholder ARN format described in task P2-T1.2
- Correct test import paths in test_cc_preflight.py
- Add missing unit tests for the newly implemented features

### Acceptance Criteria (AC):
- CLI argument `--condition-values` is implemented in cc_preflight.py
- Condition evaluation logic is implemented, including parsing the Conditions block and evaluating Fn::Equals
- Fn::GetAtt implementation returns detailed placeholder ARNs as described in task P2-T1.2
- Import statements in test_cc_preflight.py are corrected to import from the appropriate modules
- Unit tests for condition handling logic and enhanced Fn::GetAtt are added
- All existing and new tests pass

## Planning
- **Dependencies**: P5-T5.1-VerifyCompletionConsistencyTestability
- **Effort**: Medium
- **Start Date**: 2025-05-16 21:41
- **End Date**: 2025-05-16 22:30

## Documentation
### Outcome/Summary:
Successfully implemented all the required changes to address the discrepancies identified in task P5-T5.1:

1. **Enhanced Fn::GetAtt Implementation**:
   - Updated the `Fn::GetAtt` handling in `value_resolver.py` to return detailed placeholder ARNs for different resource types.
   - Implemented specific ARN formats for IAM Roles, S3 Buckets, Lambda Functions, SQS Queues, SNS Topics, KMS Keys, and CloudTrail Trails.
   - Added comprehensive unit tests for the enhanced implementation.

2. **Condition Handling Logic**:
   - Added the `--condition-values` CLI argument to `cc_preflight.py` to accept condition values as JSON input.
   - Implemented the `evaluate_condition` function to evaluate conditions based on input values or the template's Conditions block.
   - Added logic to parse and evaluate `Fn::Equals` conditions and references to other conditions.
   - Implemented condition evaluation for resources with a `Condition` property, skipping resources when their condition evaluates to false.
   - Created a new test file `test_condition_handling.py` with comprehensive tests for the condition handling logic.

3. **Fixed Import Paths**:
   - Corrected the import statements in `test_cc_preflight.py` to import from the appropriate modules:
     - `resolve_value` and `PSEUDO_PARAMETER_RESOLUTIONS` from `value_resolver`
     - `RESOURCE_ACTION_MAP` from `resource_map`

4. **Added Missing Tests**:
   - Enhanced `test_value_resolver.py` with additional tests for the detailed `Fn::GetAtt` resolution.
   - Created a new test file `test_condition_handling.py` with tests for condition evaluation.

All changes have been implemented according to the requirements specified in the original tasks (P2-T1.2, P2-T2.1, and P2-T2.2).
