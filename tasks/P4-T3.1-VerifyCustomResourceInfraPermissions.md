## Task Identification
- **Task #**: P4-T3.1
- **Task Title**: Verify Permissions for Custom Resource Backing Infrastructure
- **Task Assigned to**: Code Mode
- **Task Assigned from**: Architect Mode (Task 1.1.1)
- **Task Priority**: High
- **Task Status**: Assigned

## Task Details
### Requirements:
- Enhance the script to identify `Custom::*` resources in the CloudFormation template (e.g., `Custom::LambdaBackedResource` in the Cortex XDR CFT).
- For each Custom Resource, identify its backing AWS Lambda function (specified by the `ServiceToken` property, which usually resolves to the Lambda function's ARN).
- Identify the IAM Execution Role associated with that Lambda function.
- The script must robustly check the deploying principal's permissions to:
    - Create/Update the backing `AWS::Lambda::Function`.
    - Create/Update the associated `AWS::IAM::Role` (the Lambda execution role).
    - Perform `iam:PassRole` to assign the execution role to the Lambda function.
- This involves looking up the definitions of the Lambda function and its role if they are also defined within the same template.

### Acceptance Criteria (AC):
- The script correctly identifies all `Custom::*` resources in the [`connectors_aws_cf-d33f925f6195475daf212fdc8b1919e2-1747407759.yml`](connectors_aws_cf-d33f925f6195475daf212fdc8b1919e2-1747407759.yml).
- For each Custom Resource, the script successfully identifies its backing Lambda function and IAM execution role by resolving the `ServiceToken`.
- The script simulates and reports on the deploying principal's permissions to create/update the Lambda function itself.
- The script simulates and reports on the deploying principal's permissions to create/update the Lambda's execution role.
- The script simulates and reports on the deploying principal's `iam:PassRole` permission for assigning the execution role to the Lambda.
- Checks are accurate even if the Lambda and/or Role are defined elsewhere in the template and referenced via `!Ref` or `!GetAtt` in the `ServiceToken`.

## Planning & Tracking
- **Task Dependencies**: Robust intrinsic function resolution (Phase 1 & 2, especially for `ServiceToken`), `iam:PassRole` handling (Phase 3).
